From our first meeting to closing day, they were professional, knowledgeable, and truly dedicated to getting the best outcome for me. They provided expert advice on pricing, staging, and marketing, and their strategy brought in strong interest right away. Communication was consistent and clear, and I always felt like I was in good hands. They went above and beyond, handling every detail with care and making what could have been a stressful process feel smooth and manageable. Thanks to their expertise and hard work, my home sold quickly and at a great price. I highly recommend Reza Barghlameno to anyone looking to buy or sell a home—you won’t be disappointed!",
