## Automated Testing

### Running Unit Tests

npm test
```

### Test Coverage Areas

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Neighborhood scores are mocked** - In production, these should come from real APIs

3. **Export functionality** - Print function is basic

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Save comparison sessions** for later viewing
2. **Share comparison links** with others

5. **Property history comparison** (price changes over time)
6. **Advanced filtering** within comparison view

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Drag & Drop Not Working**:
   - Ensure @dnd-kit libraries are properly installed
   - Check browser compatibility (modern browsers required)

2. **Sticky Headers Not Sticking**:
   - Verify CSS sticky support in browser
   - Check for conflicting z-index styles

3. **Mortgage Calculator Not Updating**:
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Check for console errors

4. **Property Images Not Loading**:
   - Fallback images should automatically load
   - Check network connectivity for external images

5. **Performance Issues**:
   - Reduce number of properties in comparison
   - Check for memory leaks in browser dev tools
